# Snillrik Robots WP Plugin
Plugin for adding robots via IP controlled from browser.

## What is diz?
Will be posting more here soon, but it's a wordpress plugin for socket connection to ESP32 (or arduino with wifi).
The idea is to use the browsers GamePad functionalltiy, name axis and buttons and send the information to an ESP32 to like "steer left" or "stop".
 
Code for the ESP32 is comming later. ;)

## Plan for development
New stuff comming when I got time to play next time. :D
